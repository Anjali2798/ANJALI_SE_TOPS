   With point: float= 67.32, -97.123456
   it can store upto six digit.

   double:-34.1234567899
  
   Character : char = a to z alphabet

      num1 is correct way
  2] variable should not contain the white spaces
  ex; no of books is wrong way
      no_of_books is correct way
  3] variable should not contain the keyword
      keyword=reserved or predefined word
  4] Variable must start with a-z,A-Z or _
     ex; a=10
         A=10

   function: function is a block of code that we can use again and again.
   it provides the reusability because u can call same function as many times as u want
   types of function:
   1] library or inbuilt functions
            printf,scanf,main  
   2] User Defined Function: which is defined by user.
          ex,greetings(),sum(),factorial()

    
   1] function declaration: we will declare the function
   2]function calling: we will calling the function

   syntax:

             datatype function name() //function declaration
       {
 
                    block of code
        }
main()
   {
                  functionname(); //function calling
}

     | DAY 15 = 15 SEPT |

    categories of function:
 1] Function without parameters and without return type ex; login() in flipkart
 2] Function with parameters and without return type ex; login(email,mobile) here email and mobile are parameters
 3] Function without parameters and with return type ex; click on chocolate menu button and it will return chocolate menu page
 4] Function with parameters and with return type ex;  login(email,mobile)
            enter email=anjalisonejee@gmail.com
          if it mail matches
               it will return home page
          
         if mail not matches
              it will return invalid email
   syntax:

       datatype funname(int a, int b)//()ma lakhyu che e parameters che //function declaration
         {
            block of code

         }
        main()
         {
            funname(10,20);//()arguments che
         }
       interview question: difference between parameters and arguments
  parameters: when we write variables during function declaration is called parameters.
  arguments:the value which we will write during function calling is called arguments. //jetla parameters lai e etla j arguments keva pade.
  return value: it returns some value.


           
 recursion function:
  recursion  is a special function that will call itself.
a function which will call itself is called recursive function and this method is known as recursion.
 note:
 it works only on function with parameters.
 it works based on given condition
 syntax:
     datatype funname()
    { 
          condition
       {
          statement;
          funname();

     } 
     main()
      {
        funname();

      }
       


pointers
structure 
union 

   | DAY 16 20 SEPT|
 
 Pointers:
  ponter is used to find the memory address of any variable
  pointer : %p
  hexdecimal : %x
  address : %a

  *p,*q,*r
  
 structure and union:
 strucutre is an user defined data type which is used to store multiple value in a single entity.
 interview que: 
 difference between array and strucutre:
 array will store multiple values of single datatype in a single element but structure will store elements of multiple datatypes.
 
 total size of struture is 28 bytes.
 syntax:
  struct structurename
  {
       datatype1 var1,var2,var3;
       datatype2 var4,var5;
  };
  main()
{
    struct varname
 }

difference between structure and union:
 size of structure 28 byters
 size of union 20 bytes nu hovu joi e
