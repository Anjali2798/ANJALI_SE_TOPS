              DATABASE ASSIGNMENT

1]WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND BY DATABASE: Database is made up of a collection of tables that stores a specific set of 
structured data. A table contains a collection of rows and columns. it is also a software tool that enables users to
 manage a database easily

2] WHAT IS NORMALIZATION?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. It includes creating tables and 
establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the data
 and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

3] WHAT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEM DBMS AND RDBMS?
In DBMS, data is stored as a file, while in RDBMS, 
data is stored in the form of tables. DBMS supports single users, 
whereas RDBMS supports multiple users. DBMS does not support client-server architecture
but RDBMS does. DBMS has lower software and hardware requirements than RDBMS.

4]What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?
If someone add some data in current table, trigger helps you to find out what data is added on which time.
create trigger [trigger_name] 

[before | after]  

{insert | update | delete}  

on [table_name]  

[for each row]  

[trigger_body]
