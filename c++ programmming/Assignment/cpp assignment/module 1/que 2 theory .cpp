//2 What is OOP? List OOP concepts
/* OOP is Object Oriented Programming language
OOP concepts:

1]encapsulation:  : Encapsulation is a process of wrapping up data in a single entity     
 there are two methods in encapsulation : setter and getter

setter: setter is used to set the data
getter: getter is used to get the data 




2]abstraction
abstraction is used to hide the background implementation from the user and
slow onlu necessary information to the user
it shows only necessary information to the user
it has two types:
1]abstraction through header files
2]abstraction through class




3]inheritance
when properties of one class inherits the properties of another class is called inheritance.

parent class = base class = super class
child class = derived class = sub class

child class will inherit all the properties of parent class
inheritance is used to reduce our code as we can access other class properites

types of inheritance:

1] single level inheritance:

   class A
     | 
     |
   class B

2]multi level inheritance:

  class A
   |
  class B
   |
  class C 

3]multiple inheritance:
   class A class B
           |
        class C

4]Hierarchical inheritance
   when one parent class have multiple child class is called hierarchiacl 
   inheritance

5]hybrid inheritance
it is a combination of different inheritance








4]polymorphism
polymorphism derives from greek word
poly means many and morphism means forms
so polymorphism is many forms
so polymorphism is defined as a class which have different form

there are two types of polymorphism
1]method/function overloading(compile time)//class ni andar method kevay and class ni bahar hoy to function 
  when a class having a same method name but different parameter is called
  method overloading
2]method overriding(run time)
  when parent class and child class have same method name is called method
  overriding
